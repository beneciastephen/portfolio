                        Learning App Prototype</h5>
                    <p>EcoQuest is an AR-based educational game designed to
                         teach environmental stewardship through interactive,
                          adventure-driven tasks. Players explore their 
                          surroundings using their device’s camera to complete
                           missions like collecting litter or protecting 
                           wildlife, all while following a storyline that
                            mirrors a real ecosystem. The app’s intuitive 
                            interface, gamified goals, and animated AR 
                            elements make learning engaging for users ages 
                            10–16, encouraging real-world eco-friendly behaviors
                             through immersive play.</p>

                    <h5>Single page Front-End Website for a Mystery Game</h5>
                    <p>The Vanishing is my first ever web design project, a single-page 
                        website created to practice and deepen my understanding of HTML 
                        and CSS. This project explores dark, moody aesthetics, intuitive
                         navigation, and interactive elements to enhance the storytelling
                          experience of a mystery-adventure game. By experimenting with
                           typography, layout, and styling techniques, I aimed to create
                            an engaging and immersive design while strengthening my 
                            front-end development skills.</p>

                    <h2>Restoring My Crown</h2>
                    <h5>Exploring Digital Narratives in Web Design</h5>
                    <p>The main idea of Restoring Your Crown is to explore how media has
                         influenced the self-esteem of Black women by promoting Eurocentric
                          beauty standards. It shares a personal journey of struggling with 
                          self-image because of natural hair while educating others on the 
                          historical impact media has had on cultural beauty norms.
                    This project is framed as a cultural narrative by combining lived
                     experience with history and research. It highlights how Black hair 
                     has been misrepresented in the media, stigmatized in society, and 
                     ultimately reclaimed as a symbol of pride and identity. The project
                      is relevant because these harmful standards still affect how Black
                       women see themselves today. It encourages reflection, conversation, and healing.</p>
