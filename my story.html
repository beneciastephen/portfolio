                <p>Growing up as a first-generation American, I learned early
                     on the value of perseverance and hard work. My parents 
                     immigrated to the United States with dreams of providing
                      a better life for our family, and their journey 
                      instilled in me a deep appreciation for opportunity 
                      and education.</p>

                <p>From a young age, I was fascinated by 
                      technology and design, often spending hours exploring 
                      digital experiences, like drawing and designing in platforms 
                      like Procreate and Canva. My father being a tech-nerd like me helped a lot in trying to
                       navigate the industry and figuring out how to use my talents in my future career.</p>

                <p>As I pursued my studies in Digital Media at the University 
                    of Central Florida, I discovered a passion for UX/UI design. 
                    I realized that great design is not just about aesthetics, 
                    but about creating meaningful and accessible experiences 
                    that resonate with users. This realization has driven me to 
                    focus on user-centered design principles, ensuring that my 
                    work is both functional and engaging.</p>

                <p>While I call this "my" story, it wouldn't be possible without
                    the people who have always supported and believed in me. Even before 
                    I could fully understand the significance of their sacrifices, my parents were always there.

                <p>So in all, my story is also theirs, as I strive to honor their dreams through my own journey. 
                    I thank my parents for teaching me the value of hard work and resilience, 
                    shaping me into the woman I am today. As I look to the future, I am excited to continue my journey in UX/UI design, 
                    leveraging my skills and experiences to create impactful digital experiences. 
                    I am committed to lifelong learning and growth, always striving to push the boundaries 
                    of what is possible in design and technology.</p>
